## Introduction

This repository is intended to my own usage for building my portfolio, by using react (NextJS) i will able to make various interesting things. I will deploy this repo on [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com). Many project that i have done is deployed on vercel on demo mode, sometimes i still tinkering with my previous projects to improve features or code base just for learning. Hope you like your visit in my github.

## Regarding My Projects Demo in Vercel Deployment

I will deploy my latest project demo in vercel. My previous projects will be discarded from deployment, but you can still try my previous projects on your localhost with cloning my repository and some tweaking for `.env` in webs and api root. You can follow the `.env` with `.env.template` i prepared on each project.

## My Future Plans

### Deploying my project demo

If time and money comes by, I will try to hosting my own server or using VPS by renting some affordable and quality services. I will try to transfer my project to there, so it can be accessed without limitation from third-party services (except from hosting service).

### Improving my Skills

Eventhough i'm carrer switching from my previous carrer. I'm still striving and thirst againts knowledge in technologies, mainly in computer engineering. So right now step-by-step I'm still learning and reading many basic & principle books around programming language and networking (and some machine learning & data science) to gain depth of knowledge that i needed. Feel free to recommend me your favorite book / hidden gems book.

## My Thank You for You

Thanks for visiting my portfolio, hope your visit here not wasting your time. I hope i can collaborate with you and your team if you need my skills and knowledge, so we can make somethings that shook the world

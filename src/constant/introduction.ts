            I'm a Full-stack web developer. My primary stack includes React.js with the Next.js framework for the frontend, and Node.js with Express.js for backend 
            logic and RESTful APIs. I use Prisma ORM for schema design and data management with MySQL or PostgreSQL databases. 
            My demo projects are deployed on Vercel, using Supabase as a temporary database. Right now, I'm working on expanding my knowledge of Go programming, 
            diving deeper into advanced Next.js concepts, and improving my expertise in end-to-end (E2E) testing for better CI/CD in my upcoming projects.
